    "addition":"Addition is like combining two numbers to get the total,the total is also known as the sum /n simple one digit numbers can be added by keeping one number in mind and other number in you hand ",
    "subtraction":" subtraction is the exact opposite of addition in addition we add/combine two numbers but in subtraction we take way or reduce the numbers \n i.e if we have something in quantity of 7 and we tke 5 from it it will be 2  that is 7-5= 2,  ",
    "pythagorean theorem ":"In a right-angles triangle , (for now we will take b as right-angle) \n the opposite side of the right angle is called hypotenuse and the formula to calculate hypotenuse is a square + b square = c square . here a and b are the two sides other than the hypotenuse, to find other sides it is just reverse of finding the hypotenuse \n i.e a squared - c squared = b squared ",
    "multiplication":"this is repeated addition \n in addition we add every single time but in multiplication we add the number in one go \n 3 x 4 = 12 , that is as sames 3+3+3+3 = 12 \n here we added 3 four times , but for larger number we can use grid multiplication method to find the product",
    "trignometry ": {"main":"trignomentry is the study of  the angles and sides of a triangle \n to know more about it please type trignometry_theorem_(and the thorm you want)........e.x : trignomentry_theorem_angle"
